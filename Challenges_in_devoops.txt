Challenges for the development team:
The competitive market creates on-time delivery pressure.
They have to take care of production-ready code management and new feature implementation.
The release cycle is often long and hence the development team has to make assumptions before the application deployment finally takes place. In such a scenario, it takes more time to fix the issues that occurred during deployment in the staging or production environment.

Challenges for the operations team:
Resource contention: It's difficult to handle increasing resource demands
Redesigning or tweaking: This is needed to run the application in the production environment
Diagnosing and rectifying: They are supposed to diagnose and rectify issues after application deployment in isolation
